# Allianz Open Source Program Office

This is the OSPO website and the central hub for the open source community at Allianz.

## Our Mission

The Allianz Open Source Team is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge, 
collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful open source projects.  
We work across departments to remove barriers for consuming and contributing to open source code.

We advise and assist on:

* Providing guidance to Allianz employees on how to participate appropriately in open source communities
* Educating the legal aspects of copyright law and using open source software in compliance with its license terms
* Signing and managing Contributor License Agreements
* Adopting new open source technologies that can improve efficiency and support innovation for internal development
* Anwsering any kind of question that arise when working in context of open source projects


## Purpose of this repository
This repository primary serves the public website containing Allianz guidelines and best practices. 
Any change is suggested, discussed and executed openly with the help of issues and pull requests. 
Effectively the OSPO is an open source project itself. 

## Contributing

Our project backlog is public and can be found under the projects page. If you want to contribute you can pick
an existing issue or create a new one to discuss the intended changes.

You can preview any content change of the website very easily using Github Codespaces 
and running the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

More details can be found in the [developer guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) and [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION.md).
