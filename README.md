# Allianz Open Source Program Office

This is the website of the Allianz Open Source Program Office (OSPO) and the central hub for the open source community at Allianz.

## Our Mission

The Allianz Open Source Team is an open community of practitioners who aim to create and share knowledge, tools, and other ways to run successful open source projects. We work across departments to remove the barriers on open source software contributions and to achieve organizational benefits from community involvement.

We advise and assist on:

* Providing guidance to Allianz employees on how to participate appropriately in open source communities
* Educating the legal aspects of copyright law and explaining the usage of open source software in compliance with its license terms
* Signing and managing Contributor License Agreements
* Adopting new open source technologies that can improve efficiency and support innovation for our internal development
* Answering any question that arise when working in context of open source projects

## Purpose of this repository

This repository serves the public website of the Allianz OSPO. It contains guidelines and open source best practices. Any change is introduced, discussed and applied openly with the help of issues and pull requests. Effectively the Allianz OSPO is an open source project itself.

## Contributing

Our project backlog is public and can be found under the projects page. If you want to contribute you can pick an existing issue or create a new one to discuss the intended changes.

The website can be modified and previewed easily using Github Codespaces. Paste the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the Codespace terminal to serve the site. More details can be found in the [developer guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) and [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION.md).
